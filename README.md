CleaningDataProject
===================
The script assignes the correct column names to the data and extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurement for each measure variable. 

After the script combines all the data into a single table for all the training and test data and the measures we're interested in,finally creating a file where all the data can be seen in a easy to read archive that meets the requirements for tidy data.
